# 📦 GitHub Inventory Analysis 
**Project Code:** B44_DA_002_Inventory Analysis  
**By:** [Waswi chinchkhede]

---

🚀 **Overview**  
The Inventory Data Cleaning and Dynamic Dashboard Project delivers a full pipeline — from raw, unstructured inventory data to an insightful, interactive Power BI dashboard.  
This project includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **business intelligence (BI) visualization** — **completely developed individually**.

---

🎯 **Objectives**
- 📡 **Data Transformation**: Clean and preprocess messy inventory data for analysis.
- 📊 **Dynamic Visualization**: Build interactive dashboards using Power BI.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- 🚀 **Scalable Data Solutions**: Prepare datasets for future machine learning integration.

---

📌 **Features**
- ✅ **Advanced Data Cleaning**: Dealing with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
- 📊 **Powerful EDA**: Statistical summaries, visual explorations, and key insights extraction.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: KPIs, filters, and graphical breakdowns of inventory trends.
- 🚀 **Cleaned Dataset Ready for Deployment**: Structured data suitable for further predictive modeling.

---

🏗️ **Project Workflow**
1. **Initial Setup**: Install Python (for Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI Desktop.
2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Open `Data_Cleaning_and_EDA.ipynb`.
   - Process the `Github Indian users Uncleaned data.csv` raw file.
   - Save the output as `inventory_cleaned_data.csv`.
3. **Data Exploration**:  
   - Perform EDA inside the notebook to identify patterns and anomalies.
4. **Database Creation**:
   - Store Airbnb data in MySQL and establish a connection with Power BI.
5. **Dashboard Development**:  
   - Load the cleaned data into `Inventory Analysis.pbix`.
   - Build and customize the dashboard with KPIs, bar charts, pie charts, and filters.
6. **Final Validation**:  
   - Test the dashboard for interactivity and clarity.
